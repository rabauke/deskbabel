# DeskBabel

DeskBabel is a cross-platform offline dictionary written in Qt6. Note that this program does not include translations or wordlists. Just copy your own set of translations to a text file in the sub-folder Dictionaries within the Documents directory. This file is expected to contain two tab-separated columns each containing a word or phrase in one language and its translation into another language, respectively. Dictionary text files may be downloaded from e.g. http://www1.dict.cc/translation_file_request.php?l=e Depending on the dictionary's size SailBabel may require a large amount of memory. Close other apps before starting SailBabel if there is insufficient memory.
